## General Information
The fraud detection system is designed to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning models. The system employs multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to detect potential fraud. The transaction data is cleaned and prepared to suit the needs of these models. A RESTful API is created using Flask to allow users to submit transactions and receive predictions on their fraudulent nature. The API handles requests and returns predictions, making it easy to integrate with other systems.
